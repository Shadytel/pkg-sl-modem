What's been changed:
--------------------

- in kernel 2.6.24 the macro SA_SHIRQ is undefined (it was deprecated - and
  redefined to IRQF_SHARED - since some previous kernel, I think 2.6.22).
  The code now use IRQF_SHARED if it's defined, and fall back to SA_SHIRQ if
  IRQF_SHARED is undef

- every use of pci_find_device function has been replaced with the pair
  pci_get_device/pci_dev_put. pci_get_device is the recommended way to look
  for a pci device since some earlier 2.6.x kernel, and pci_find_device has
  been left for backward compatibility, but may be removed in some next
  kernel version. The side effect is that you don't need to have
  CONFIG_PCI_LEGACY defined in your kernel .config (choice Bus
  Options->Enable deprecated pci_find_* API).

- some explicit casts have been added to prevent some signedness mismatch
  warnings when compiling

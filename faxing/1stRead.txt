The scripts in this folder were provided by Jean-Pierre Demailly.
The test modem is on a High Definition Audio card:
   Class 0403: 8086:284b Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H
   Primary PCI_id  8086:284b
   Subsystem PCI_id  103c:30cc
       hosting Motorola chip 0x1057305

The software for Microsoft provided by Motorola has a sm56 designation.
However the applicability of the Jean-Pierre's scripts most likely extends
to any modem supportable with the slmodemd helper utility.
Some modifications of the scripts may be necessary for these other modems.

Hi:

Thanks to your previous help, I have been able to get my winmodem
Smartlink SM56 to work at least partially on my x86_64 laptop
(with a 64 bit kernel). However, some tweaks were necessary :

1. The slmodem package fails to compile properly from scratch because
  * the Makefile forgets to uses the -m32 option to force compilation
    in 32 bit (necessary because of needed ld with 32 bit blobs)
  * the slamr driver which is pure 32 bit cannot be compiled on a
    a 64 bit machine, and so the Makefile should disable this
    automatically. I enclose a Makefile which includes this test.
    
2. After tweaking as in 1), compilation of slmodemd in 32bit mode is
   successful and I could call
      slmodem -c FRANCE --alsa hw:0,6
   (as this seems to be appropriate in my case).
   Then device /dev/ttySL0 is created
   
However, when trying using to use the modem, I first got an error
    period size 48 not supported by playback (64)
(already reported by many people). Things improved a lot by using
the "Hell labs patch" enclosed - it seems that a test fax (class 1)
was succesfully sent. Maybe the change should be implemented in the
next iteration of slmodemd and enabled/disabled through the use of an 
ad hoc option. 

I also got French Minitel (V23 mode) almost working - the initializing
escape code is probably still not OK as the echo of keys was garbled.
In addition, there is not sound on dialing - maybe the hell labs patch
simply disables error after failure of using ALSA. Alsa support
obviously has to be fixed for SM56 on 64 bit machines.

Here is where I am - it seems pretty close to be made to work, but not
there yet !

Regards,
Jean-Pierre Demailly

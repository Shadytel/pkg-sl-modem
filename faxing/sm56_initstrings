      -Register Option Description
      S0  Auto-Answer on Ring Number
      S0=0 Disable
      S0=n Answer on Ring n; n=0 to 255
      S1  Ring Count
      S1=n Counts the number of rings in an incoming call.  If the modem is
      configured to auto-answer (S0 set to a non-zero option), when S1=S0, the
      modem answers the call.
      S2  Select Escape Character
      S2=n Specifies ASCII character for Escape; n=0 to 255. Default = 43 (+)
      S3  Select Carriage-Return Character
      S3=n Specifies ASCII character for Carriage-Return; n=0 to 127. Default
      = 13 (CR)
      S4  Select Line-Feed Character
      S4=n Specifies ASCII character for Line-Feed; n=0 to 127. Default = 10
      (LF)
      S5  Select Backspace Character
      S5=n Specifies ASCII Character for Backspace; n=0 to 127. Default = 8
      (BS)
      S6  Blind Dial
      S6=n Before dialing, the modem goes off-hook and waits n seconds; n=0 to
      255. Note: When the ATX2 or ATX4 option is in effect, the S6 value is
      disregarded.Default = 2
      S7  Call Time-out
      S7=n Pause for n seconds; n=0 to 255; before dialing. Default = 60
      S8  Pause Delay
      S8=n Pause for n seconds; n=0 to 255; for dial modifier in a dial
      string. Default = 2
      S10  DCD Loss Disconnect
      S10=n Disconnect after n seconds; n=0 to 255 in 0.1 second increments;
      after DCD signal is de-asserted.  Default = 14
      S11  Tone Length
      S11=n Specifies duration, in 0.001 second increments, of DTMF tone when
      it is generated; n=60 to 255. Default =72
      S12  Escape Code Guard Time
      S12=n Specifies the interval, in 0.02-second increments, that must be
      present on either side of the escape code (+++) for the modem to
      recognize the escape command and enter command mode.  If S12=0, the
      speed at which you enter the escape sequence is not a factor. Default =
      50
      S18  Test Timer
      S18=n Specifies test execution duration; n=0 to 255. Default = 0

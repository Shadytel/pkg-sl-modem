sl-modem (2.9.11~20090222-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Starting with this version, module-assistant support has been removed.
    Building of slamr and slusb modules can either be done automatically using
    DKMS, or done manually.
  * Also slamr and slusb devices nodes are not created during package install.
    They are created automatically when the respective module is loaded. Yet 
    this works only for one modem on the machine.

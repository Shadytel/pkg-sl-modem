This package was debianized by Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org> on
Sun, 16 Mar 2003 16:37:46 +0100.

This package ships two 32-bit binary blobs (modem/dsplibs.o and
drivers/amrlibs.o) for which no source is provided.  Consequently,
the package is in non-free in Debian.  Sl-Modem is released under BSD
and there should not be any legal issues with autobuilding the package.

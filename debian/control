Description: SmartLink software modem driver - module building source
 This package contains source code for the low-level drivers for the
 software modems produced by Smart Link Ltd. It supports PCI and USB models.
 .
 In addition to this package, you will need the package sl-modem-daemon
 which implements the application part of the driver.
 .
 Module packages can be built for the custom kernel package either by hand or
 using DKMS.

Description: SmartLink software modem daemon
 The SmartLink modem daemon is the application part of the
 driver for recent modems produced by Smart Link Ltd.
 .
 This package replaces (along with hardware access drivers) the old
 driver generation (2.7.x) which consisted of kernel modules only.
 .
 It needs a kernel driver to access the hardware. This can be either
 recent ALSA (shipped with a newer kernel (>=2.6.4) with Alsa support
 and intel8x0m module) which is sufficient for basic operation and
 data/Internet connection, or the SmartLink kernel driver which is
 provided by separate packages which you can build using the source from
 the sl-modem-source package.

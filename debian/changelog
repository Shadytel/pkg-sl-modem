sl-modem (2.9.9d-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * added alternative debconf-2.0 dependency
  * http://dev.gentoo.org/~genstef/files/slmodem-class-simple-to-class.diff
    added with few modifications though does not solve #325799 yet
  * added patch http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/archive-fifth/msg02217.html
    which AFAICS basically ignores the PCI ID collision caused by the kernel
    source bugs #303844 and #322028 (closes: #321061). Should be fixed in the
    kernel, though.

sl-modem (2.9.9d-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * the "Lesson I: never trust ALSA's procfs entries" release
  * no longer relies on /proc/asound/[Mm]odem link, instead parses
    /proc/asound/cards
  * rewrote parts of the init script to put all recent extensions into a
    proper control flow
  * fixed a bashism in debian/sl-modem-daemon.postinst

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Aug 2005 17:01:07 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.9d-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * extended modprobe calls in the init script to try non-Intel drivers for
    mainboard chipsets (closes: #320620)
  * fixed a bashism in the init script
  * removed the hard kernel-image-* dependency from the modules contol
    file (closes: #321570)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 06 Aug 2005 15:23:13 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.9d-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed the ALSA device name from hw: to modem: because weird device
    driver using additional filters applied only then (closes: #320190).
    In addition, set the build dependency on a recent libasound2 version to
    enforce the upgrade.

sl-modem (2.9.9d-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + moves the device major numbers to the 24x range (closes: #264359)
  * replaced the mkdev hacks in init script etc. with only one in the postinst
    of modules that also fixes the major numbers of the device files. Also
    make sure they don't make the script fail on insane /dev filesystems
    (udev, closes: #297666)
  * init script patch from Stephen Gildea <gildea@stop.mail-abuse.org> to
    improve the start/stop behaviour and ALSA detection (closes: #312884)
  * removed the dependency on recent modules or kernel. There are too many
    ways to make the daemon work and a modern kernel (2.6.12) provides enough
    support to make it work without special cludges using the packaging
    system (closes: #319604)
  * added bzip2 to dependencies (closes: #312152)
  * Japanese translation by Hideki Yamane <henrich@samba.gr.jp>(closes: #281074)

  * various lintian fixes, removing the init script in postrm now (arrrg)

sl-modem (2.9.8-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added cs.po from Miroslav Jezbera (closes: #260359)
  * Changes by karlheg@pdx.edu:
    - Patch modem/modem.h to enlarge dial string buffer to 128 bytes. Some
      dial strings that include calling card numbers can be longer than the
      previously allowed 32 characters, causing them to be truncated.
    - Add libasound2-dev to Build-Depends in debian/control

sl-modem (2.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #249810)
  * modified the init script to be more smart on autodetection. The existance
    of the ALSA driver is checked not only by looking at modules now
    (closes: #246950)
  * added dependency on kernel-image-2.6 in the hope that people will install
    a recent kernel (since versioned Provides: are not possible) as
    alternative to the source package or installed modules (closes: #247476)

  * (fixed in -4): using , as RegExp delimiter when setting the country
    value (closes: #241210)
  * first experimental hotplug agent for one USB modem

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 2004 10:23:41 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

    because of wrong tar options
  * Danish template translation by Morten Brix Pedersen <morten@wtf.dk>
    (closes: #241040)

  * fixed typos in the init script (Closes: #235454)
  * moved section to "non-free/net" (it is a modem driver, after all), and
    "contrib/net" for modules (-source) packages (the kernel part is free
    software)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Feb 2004 13:16:31 +0100

sl-modem (2.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #234010 and clarifies issues brought up by
    license nit-pickers)
  * Installs the .ko files on linux 2.6.x (closes: #231204)
  * Hiding unhelpfull error messages - if they appear, the command was
    deliberate (closes: #232102)
  * corrected README.Debian to mention .bz2 instead of .gz (closes: #233231)
  * better README.Debian for the -daemon package (closes:  #233242)

    including /etc/defaults/slmodemd along with /etc/defaults/sl-modem-daemon

sl-modem (2.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Providing "slmodem" from the source package. Not the perfect solution but
    a working one, helping users that look for wrong keywords (closes: #228416)
  * debian/rules and Makefile cleanup to not loose the user-specified kernel
    version string and blindly try include modversions.h (solves #228841 as-is
    but shows the missing support for kernel 2.6.0 in the old driver branch)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jan 2004 14:26:01 +0100

sl-modem (2.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Fixed installation order and paths, thanks to Dorneles Trem√©a
    <dorneles@x3ng.com.br>; also review and fixes of the county.dat
    installation hook and the module postinst hook, separating for different
    driver branches (closes: #218619, #218005)
  * Help request: I do not have hardware to test the drivers from the new
    branch. Your chance to become comaintainer if you have hardware supported
    by the new driver branch.
  * init script improvements, proper default file

sl-modem (2.9.11~20080817-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #354908, #489289, #457637, LP: #144090, #269855)
  * Adopting sl-modem. (Closes: #471888)
  * Removed the following patches since they are applied upstream:
    + patch to define URB_ASYNC_UNLINK if not set
    + patch that adds alternative MODULE_PARM function (module_param)
    + patch removing the inclusion of config.h
    + patch making a biarch build with lib32 package versions
    + patches fixing buils with kernel versions 2.6.16, 2.6.18 and 2.6.26
  * Remove cmd.patch and pcireg.patch as they are applied upstream.
  * Used quilt patch system.
    + Moved slmodem-class-simple-to-class-meins.diff to debian/patches/
    + 01_Makefile.diff: Makefile cleanup to not loose the user-specified
      kernel version string.
    + modem_group.diff: set the default device group to "dialout".
    + 02_dial_string_size.diff: enlarge dial string buffer to 128 bytes
    + 03_Makefile_2.6.12.4.diff: workaround in drivers/Makefile for a kernel
      2.4 check accidentialy matching 2.6.12.4.
    + 04_sregs_init.diff
    + 05_st7554_license.diff: changed the MODULE_LICENSE string to
      "Dual BSD/GPL" since the license is actually a BSD license clone.
    + 06_slmodem-class-simple-to-class-meins.diff: patch for
      class/simple_class transition.
    + 08_ungrab_winmodem.diff: helper module to tell the kernel to keep away
      from unsupported PCI id numbers.
    + 10_drop_privileges.diff: slmodemd privilege dropping patch.
    + 11_logfile.diff: place debug log in /var/log/slmodem.log.
    + kernel-ver.diff: workaround for pre-2.6.18 kernels.
    + README.diff: Dropped the TROUBLESHOOTING section from README and adapted
      the feedback section, mentioned the transfer of the modem business to
      Conexant.
    + debug_level.diff: debug log file is not for end users. Users shall use
      -l <number>.
  * Added fortify_source.diff patch to fix FTBFS with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
    compile flag.
  * Synch'ed ungrab-winmodem.c from
    http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/smartlink/ungrab-winmodem-20080126.tar.gz.
  * Remove debian/control.backup* as I don't see any use for them.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.0.
  * Added watch file.
  * debian/rules: slusb support ends at 2.6.24, hence add a check for kernel
    sublevel, to prevent the attempt to install non-existing slusb.ko. Thanks
    to Maurizio Avogadro for the suggestion.
  * Translation updates: Swedish, German, Basque, French, Italian, Czech,
    Portuguese, Finnish, Japanese and Russian (Closes: #501038, #501043,
    #501065, #501102, #501108, #501213, #501225, #501701, #501632, #501593).
  * New translation: Arabic (Closes: #501196).
  * debian/control: Added Maurizio Avogadro to Uploaders field.
  * debian/sl-modem-daemon.init: changes from Ubuntu
    + sl-modem-daemon initscript waits for aplay (from alsa-utils) to report
      the card, as it appears in /proc/asound/cards before it is actually
      available to slmodemd. This extra check defeats this race.
    + Remove hard and soft ulimits for locked-in-core memory. This daemon
      unfortunately needs quite a bit of memory and it needs to be in core
      because it's doing the real-time modem DSP. This deals with LP: #144468
      and probably other bugs too.

  [Maurizio Avogadro]
  * debian/rules: removed code to append extra lines to modprobe.d file, since
    they are statically appended in debian/sl-modem-daemon.modutils.
  * The init script can now modprobe even if the slamr module has been
    blacklisted.
  * Modified 11_logfile.diff: Fixed the log path as the slmodemd daemon runs
    as unprivileged user and didn't have write permissions on /var/log.
  * Added class_device.diff patch: since 2.6.25 class_device_add() and
    class_device_destroy() has been renamed, modified st7554.c accordingly.
  * Removed obsolete /etc/modutils file.
  * Small enhancements to the modprobe.d file:
    + verify device permissions on module install
    + modprobe cleans /dev on module remove
  * Added some troubleshooting info to README.Debian.

    which has basically the superset of our changes (plus two additional modem
    IDs) but zeroes out the class* method calls since they are "protected" by
    GPL-enforcing kernel macros now (closes: #354216)
  * the above change effectively disables the udev functionality. Send your
    complaints to kernel developers if you need it. Or suggest a better
    solution. For now, a oneliner in /etc/modprobe.d/sl-modem-daemon.modutils

    - Patch modem/modem.h to enlarge dial string buffer to 128 bytes. Some
      dial strings that include calling card numbers can be longer than the
      previously allowed 32 characters, causing them to be truncated.
    - Add libasound2-dev to Build-Depends in debian/control

sl-modem (2.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #255714)
  * postinst hook to reload modules, a phantom modprobe freeze appeared
    otherwise

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Jun 2004 23:41:55 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * source package depends on debhelper (closes: #251608)
  * loads the ALSA module with the correct name (closes: #252623)

sl-modem (2.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #249810)
  * modified the init script to be more smart on autodetection. The existance
    of the ALSA driver is checked not only by looking at modules now
    (closes: #246950)
  * added dependency on kernel-image-2.6 in the hope that people will install
    a recent kernel (since versioned Provides: are not possible) as
    alternative to the source package or installed modules (closes: #247476)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Fri, 21 May 2004 13:38:10 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.6-5) unstable; urgency=medium

    (closes: #243614)
  * ALSA support, enabled with : in SLMODEMD_DEVICE (closes: #240305)
  * README.Debian improvements: ALSA mode documentation, explicit note why
    sl-modem is non-free (closes: Bug#242241)
  * (fixed in -4): using , as RegExp delimiter when setting the country
    value (closes: #241210)
  * first experimental hotplug agent for one USB modem

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 2004 10:23:41 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * the driver source contents were not included in the previos version
    because of wrong tar options
  * Danish template translation by Morten Brix Pedersen <morten@wtf.dk>
    (closes: #241040)
  * added [ ] in the modules postinst (this is not Perl ;-)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Mar 2004 01:10:06 +0200

sl-modem (2.9.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * relaxed read permissions in the tarball
  * restarting sl-modem-daemon after modules installation
  * extra check for beeing not reconfigured in the config script to not
    overwrite the selection on initial installation (closes: #239692)
  * french debconf translation by Jean-Luc Coulon (closes: #238745)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Feb 2004 21:03:54 +0100

sl-modem (2.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * finally droped the old 2.7.10 source, removed all crappy workarounds
  * debconf integration to select the country
  * changed the virtual dependency to make sure that people get the new source
    on upgrade and do not keep old driver versions installed
  * corrected the /dev/ path of SLMODEMD_DEVICE
  * set the default device group to "dialout" (Closes: #235455)
  * fixed typos in the init script (Closes: #235454)
  * moved section to "non-free/net" (it is a modem driver, after all), and
    "contrib/net" for modules (-source) packages (the kernel part is free
    software)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Feb 2004 13:16:31 +0100

sl-modem (2.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #234010 and clarifies issues brought up by
    license nit-pickers)
  * Installs the .ko files on linux 2.6.x (closes: #231204)
  * Hiding unhelpfull error messages - if they appear, the command was
    deliberate (closes: #232102)
  * corrected README.Debian to mention .bz2 instead of .gz (closes: #233231)
  * better README.Debian for the -daemon package (closes:  #233242)
  * finaly merged upstream suggested init script with my old version, now
    including /etc/defaults/slmodemd along with /etc/defaults/sl-modem-daemon
    (closes: #230200, #233244)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Feb 2004 10:12:17 +0100

sl-modem (2.9.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Providing "slmodem" from the source package. Not the perfect solution but
    a working one, helping users that look for wrong keywords (closes: #228416)
  * debian/rules and Makefile cleanup to not loose the user-specified kernel
    version string and blindly try include modversions.h (solves #228841 as-is
    but shows the missing support for kernel 2.6.0 in the old driver branch)

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jan 2004 14:26:01 +0100

sl-modem (2.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Fixed installation order and paths, thanks to Dorneles Treméa
    <dorneles@x3ng.com.br>; also review and fixes of the county.dat
    installation hook and the module postinst hook, separating for different
    driver branches (closes: #218619, #218005)
  * Help request: I do not have hardware to test the drivers from the new
    branch. Your chance to become comaintainer if you have hardware supported
    by the new driver branch.
  * init script improvements, proper default file

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jan 2004 14:26:02 +0100

sl-modem (2.7.14+2.7.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * sorted source files in the correct directories

 -- Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Sep 2003 02:54:30 +0200
